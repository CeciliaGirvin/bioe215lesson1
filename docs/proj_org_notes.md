# Project Organization Notes


## Steps next time
### Only need to be configured once: 
- Create a GitHub account
- Save credentials with a PAT (personal Access Token), every 90 days.

### Must be done for each project:
1. Create RStudio project and associated git repo (this is done directly in New Project Wizard)
2. Do a good job creating folders: data, paper, figs, output, R, reports, docs, scratch, and maybe a scripts folder if necessary
3. Activate GitHub pages (Commit > Push)
